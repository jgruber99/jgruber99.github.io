Hi, my Name is Julius and I am a 22-year old Austrian. I grew up in Linz, Austria, where I completed a humanistic high school, [Akademisches Gymnasium Linz](https://akadgymlinz.at) (hence I spent more time learning ancient languages than anyone would consider reasonable -  but at least I had fun.)

Afterwards, I enrolled for a  bachelor Degree at in Computational Science and Engineering at [ETH Zurich]( https://ethz.ch/en.html) , an interdisciplinary degree that combines (applied) math, computer science and natural science.  

Currently, I am doing an internship at [GoStudent](https://www.gostudent.org/en), an EduTech startup in Vienna, as a Data intern. I am mainly doing work in the fields of Natural Language Processing, Emotion Detection, Data Wrangling & Data Science. 

I spent my leisure time with friends & family, do some coding related stuff and I even pretend to do sports.
