This list is both for me, to create a documentation when I need to setup a new enviroment, and for other people to get some inspiration. I am mainly working with MacOS and Linux Ubuntu(However, I wanted to switch to KDE neon, as it has beautiful design possibilities). All the tools presented in the following list are available for both systems. Development Enviroments vim: Very fast \u0026 reliable. High learning curve. vscode: General Purpose IDE for all sort of languages. Tons of plugins. PyCharm: Ecspecially useful for coding in Python. RStudio: The working enviroment for R. Overleaf: Collaborative Latex Editor. Command Line Kitty: My terminal emulator of choice. iTerm: Unfortunately, only available on MacOS. Has some really nice plugins. oh-my-zsh: Many different extension possibilities and fun plugins available. how2: stackoverflow from the terminal. bat: “better” version of cat. Other tools I use on the computer Alfred: The better spotlight for MacOS todoist: My todo list of choice, even has a terminal plugin. Different files vimrc: My current vimrcm, which is constantly changing. As a package manager I use vundle. zshrc: Current zshrc, which is also changing constantly.

I grew up in Linz, Austria, where I completed a humanistic high school, Akademisches Gymnasium Linz (hence I spent more time learning ancient languages than anyone would consider reasonable - but at least I had fun.) Afterwards, I enrolled in a bachelor degree program in Computational Science and Engineering at ETH Zurich, an interdisciplinary degree that combines (applied) math, computer science and natural science. Currently, I am doing an internship at GoStudent, an EduTech startup in Vienna, as a Data Science intern. I am mainly doing work in the fields of Data Science, Data Engineering, Emotion Detection, some DevOps related stuff \u0026 a bit of Software Engineering. I spent my leisure time with friends \u0026 family, do some coding related stuff and I even pretend to do sports (check out my unactive Strave here).
